Sitecore Helix Documentation for eReaders

Sitecore Helix is the official guidelines and recommended practises for developing in Sitecore.
More information can be find here here:
- http://helix.sitecore.net/
- https://github.com/Sitecore/Helix.Docs

Official Helix documentation in above links is only in HTML and split into seperate files.
This repository contains documentation for Sitecore Helix which is suitable for eReaders.
All HTML pages from official documentation have been merged together and all unneccesary page parts have been removed (left like side menu, footer and so on). I have also added table of content.

For each version of Helix documentation you will find seperate folder and underneath 3 type of files:
- PDF - for PC, laptop screens or for general purposes; works on any eReader
- mobi - for Amazon Kindle eReaders - Specifically formatted to Kindle Voyage but working without any problem on others like Paperwhite
- ePUB - for Kobo, Pocketbook, B&N and other brands which support this format
